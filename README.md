# Modern CMake C++/CUDA template
A quick and simple CMake C++ template to start a project.

**This is a template project, so choose what you need and delete what you don't want (via add_subdirectory).**

- No additional package management, using only CMake FetchContent and Git Submodule completely.
- Distinguishing between dynamic libraries, static libraries, and header-only dependency libraries.
- Optional usage of Google Test, Doctest, and NanoBench.
